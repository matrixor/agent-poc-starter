Please include or link to any internal policies or control documents.\n- PRINCIPLE-SECRETS: How are API keys and credentials for Claude Code and other external AI services stored (e.g., Key Vault), what is the rotation schedule, and which roles or groups have access?\n- PRINCIPLE-GOV-ALIGN: Explain how this governed integration pattern aligns with the Enterprise AI Architecture objectives across reliability, security, performance, cost, and responsibility. Please provide specific mechanisms or controls for each dimension.\n- PRINCIPLE-MONITOR: What monitoring and alerting do you plan for this integration (e.g., usage metrics, error rates, latency, hallucination or misuse indicators), and what thresholds will trigger alerts or automated actions?\n- PRINCIPLE-VENDOR: What is the status of the vendor risk assessment for Claude Code and any other external AI providers, and what data residency and data handling assurances have been obtained?"
