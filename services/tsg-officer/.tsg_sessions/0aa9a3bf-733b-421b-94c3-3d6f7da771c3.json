However, all follow-up questions for required governance, security, monitoring, resilience, and responsible AI controls are answered as N/A, leaving critical controls undefined. Multiple BLOCKER-severity rules (responsible AI controls, secrets management) are not satisfied, and most WARN/INFO items lack any substantive response or planned artifacts.\n\nKey issues:\n- RULE-RESP-AI: Responsible AI controls documented\n- RULE-SECRETS: Secrets management defined\n\nEvidence (highlights):\n- BLOCKER: Responsible AI controls documented (RULE-RESP-AI) — For an external AI coding assistant, responsible AI controls are critical. The submission explicitly responds N/A and provides no alternative evidence, so this BLOCKER requirement is not met.\n  - Evidence: submission — \"Follow-up Question: RULE-RESP-AI: Describe the responsible AI controls for Claude Code...\"\n- BLOCKER: Secrets management defined (RULE-SECRETS) — No information is provided on how Claude Code API keys/credentials will be stored, rotated, or access-controlled. This is a BLOCKER for external AI consumption.\n  - Evidence: submission — \"Follow-up Question: RULE-SECRETS: How will Claude Code API keys and related credentials be stored...\"\n- WARN: Alignment to enterprise AI principles (RULE-GOV-ALIGN) — The rule requires explicit mapping to reliability, security, performance, cost, and responsibility. The answer is N/A with no alternative documentation, so alignment is not demonstrated.\n  - Evidence: submission — \"Follow-up Question: RULE-GOV-ALIGN ...\""
