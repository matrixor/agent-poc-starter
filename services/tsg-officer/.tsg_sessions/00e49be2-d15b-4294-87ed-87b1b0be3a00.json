Please provide a brief mapping for each objective.\n- PRINCIPLE-RESP-AI: What responsible AI controls are in place for Claude Code (e.g., bias evaluation of generated code, safeguards against hallucinated or insecure code suggestions, human review requirements, and escalation paths for problematic outputs)? Please include any documented policies or procedures.\n- PRINCIPLE-EVIDENCE: Which specific artifacts will you provide at review (e.g., dataflow/architecture diagram, SLO dashboards, evaluation metrics for code quality, rollback/disablement playbooks, MCP/agent registrations if applicable)?\n- PRINCIPLE-RUNBOOKS: Where will operational runbooks for the Claude Code integration be stored, who owns them, and how will multi-region teams keep them up to date?\n- PRINCIPLE-MONITOR: What monitoring and alerting will you implement for the Claude Code integration (e.g., API error rates, latency, usage anomalies, hallucination or unsafe suggestion reports, tool success/failure)? Please describe key metrics and alert thresholds."
